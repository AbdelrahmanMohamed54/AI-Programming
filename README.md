# AI-Programming

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Python for solving various types of puzzles, including mazes, the N-puzzle (sliding puzzle), and Sudoku puzzles. The implementations use classical search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search.

### Features

#### 1. Maze Solver (`Maze.py`)
   - **Description**: Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze, represented as a 2D grid.
   - **Functionality**: Solves mazes with walls, open paths, and a specified goal.
  
#### 2. Sliding Puzzle Solver (`PuzzleSolver.py`)
   - **Description**: Uses the A* search algorithm to solve N x N sliding puzzles.
   - **Functionality**: Arranges numbered tiles to achieve a specific goal state.

#### 3. Depth-First Search for Sliding Tiles (`Sliding_Tiles_DFS.py`)
   - **Description**: Applies the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to solve N x N sliding tile puzzles.
   - **Functionality**: Handles the challenge of rearranging numbered tiles in a grid format.

#### 4. BFS for Sliding Tiles (`BreadthFirstSearch_SlidingTiles.py`)
   - **Description**: Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve sliding tile puzzles in an N x N grid.
   - **Functionality**: Finds the shortest path to arrange tiles in a specified sequence.

#### 5. Sudoku Solver (`sudoku.py`)
   - **Description**: Utilizes the A* search algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles.
   - **Functionality**: Fills a 9x9 grid following Sudoku rules, ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9.

#### 6. Tic-Tac-Toe Learning Algorithm (`MENACE.py`)
   - **Description**: Implements the MENACE (Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine) for playing and learning Tic-Tac-Toe.
   - **Functionality**: Uses reinforcement learning to enhance gameplay strategy over time.

#### 7. Basic Perceptron Implementation (`Simple_perceptron.py`)
   - **Description**: Demonstrates the training of a basic Perceptron for digit recognition.
   - **Functionality**: Recognizes patterns in data using a generated dataset of noisy samples.

#### 8. Sigmoidal Perceptron (`Sigmoid_perceptron.py`)
   - **Description**: Extends the basic Perceptron model with a sigmoid activation function.
   - **Functionality**: Handles more complex patterns for digit recognition, training with noisy samples.

#### 9. Symbolic Computation (`Symbolic_computation.py`)
   - **Description**: Provides a framework for symbolic computation in algebraic expressions.
   - **Functionality**: Facilitates handling and differentiation of algebraic expressions.

#### 10. Symbolic Perceptron (`SymbolicPerceptron.py`)
   - **Description**: Merges symbolic computation with perceptron mechanics.
   - **Functionality**: Manipulates expressions in perceptron operations for a deeper understanding of neural networks.

#### 11. Logical Puzzle Solver (`SAT-SMT.py`)
   - **Description**: Solves complex logical puzzles using the Z3 SMT solver.
   - **Functionality**: Handles relationships between different sets of variables under constraints.
