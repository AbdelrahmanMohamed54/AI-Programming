# AI-Programming

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Python for solving various types of puzzles, including mazes, the N-puzzle (sliding puzzle), and Sudoku puzzles. The implementations use classical search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search.

## Features

### Search Problems:
- **Maze Solver**: Implementation of BFS to find the shortest path in a maze.
- **N-Puzzle Solver**: Solver for the NÃ—N sliding puzzle using DFS, BFS and A* search algorithms.
- **Sudoku Solver**: An A* search-based solver for Sudoku puzzles with a heuristic based on the count of empty cells.

(Expand on the above with more details if necessary.)
